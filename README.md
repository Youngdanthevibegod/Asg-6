# Asg-6
**a) Purpose of the Program(s):** The purpose of the descriptive statistics program is to get the user to input a lower bound, an upper bound, and a step size for the group. The given group should include at least 3 values. The program should then compute the mean, median, and range of the inputted group.

The purpose of the cipher program is to take a string of numbers as input and return the translated message. 

**b) Input:** The descriptive statistics program's input is the lower bound, upper bound, and step size numbers given by the user. The cipher program's input is the strings of numbers that have been provided from the given information.

**c) Expected Output:** The descriptive statistics program's output is the mean, median, and range of the inputted group. The cipher program comes out as a translated message.

**d) Type of Execution:** The type(s) of execution for the descriptive statistics and cipher program is Conditional execution.

**e) Possible Improvements:** The descriptive statistics program could be improved by: Adding an else error statement in case the user enters a float or alphabet letter. 

The cipher could be improved by: Having no negative numbers in the list or finding a way to make the code more efficient by reducing the time and resources required to make it.
